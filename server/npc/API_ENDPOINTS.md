## Data Sources

All endpoints utilizing enriched user data fetch from these MongoDB collections:

1. **users** - User account, character selection, game progress
2. **playerStates** - Position, financial data, inventory, onboarding status
3. **bankAccounts** - Bank account balances and transaction history
4. **stockPortfolios** - Current stock holdings with P&L
5. **stockTransactions** - Complete trading history (buy/sell orders)
6. **fixedDeposits** - Fixed deposit investments
7. **gameSessions** - Play session history and activities
8. **achievements** - Unlocked achievements and milestones

## Response Features

### Personalization Factors

All responses consider:
- ‚úÖ **Risk Profile:** low/medium/high (calculated from asset allocation)
- ‚úÖ **Investment Experience:** beginner/intermediate/advanced (based on transaction count and portfolio value)

## Performance Metrics

Typical response times:
- Health check: < 10ms
- Build context: 200-400ms (first time only)
- Chat queries: 250-350ms
- Conversation graphs: 250-350ms
- NPC list: < 5ms

## Usage Recommendations

### For Game Client Integration

1. **On User Login:**
   ```bash
   # Build context once per user (cache for session)
   POST /api/build-context/:userId
   ```

2. **For Simple Questions:**
   ```bash
   # Use chat endpoint for direct answers
   POST /api/chat/:userId
   {
     "query": "How's my portfolio doing?"
   }
   ```

3. **For Interactive Dialogues:**
   ```bash
   # Use conversation graph for branching NPC interactions
   POST /api/conversation-graph/:userId
   {
     "npcName": "maya",
     "topic": "investment advice"
   }
   ```

4. **For NPC Selection Screen:**
   ```bash
   # Get available NPCs and their traits
   GET /api/npcs
   ```

### Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Cache conversation trees client-side for smooth UI
- ‚úÖ Call build-context only once per user session
- ‚úÖ Use specific topics for more relevant conversation trees
- ‚úÖ Match NPC personality to user's needs (Maya for beginners, FinBot for traders, Rick for aggressive players, Beth for savers)
- ‚úÖ Monitor executionTime in responses for performance tuning

## WebSocket Support (Bonus)

The server also supports WebSocket connections for real-time chat:

**Connection:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8081?userId=68af42c4c4375cbf230ebfa9&username=GursimranSingh');

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);
  console.log(message);
};

ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  message: "Tell me about my portfolio",
  type: "user"
}));
```

**WebSocket Port:** `8081` (configurable via `WS_PORT` environment variable)

---

## Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # Required for embeddings
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...    # MongoDB Atlas connection
WS_PORT=8081                     # WebSocket server port (default: 8081)
```

## Architecture Notes

### Enriched Data Flow

1. **Request arrives** ‚Üí Extract userId from path
2. **Fetch enriched data** ‚Üí UserDataEnrichmentService queries 8 MongoDB collections in parallel
3. **Extract user profile** ‚Üí ConversationService analyzes enriched data for risk, experience, goals
4. **Generate response** ‚Üí 
   - Chat: Specialized response generator based on query type
   - Conversation: Dynamic tree generation with NPC personality
5. **Return result** ‚Üí JSON response with context and execution time

### Key Components

- **UserDataEnrichmentService:** Direct MongoDB queries for all user-related data
- **ConversationService:** User profile extraction, conversation tree generation, NPC personalities
- **ContRAG SDK:** Vector embeddings and similarity search (legacy, supplementary)
- **Express Server:** REST API and WebSocket management
