## WCHL25 Hackathon Integration (Overview)

### Blockchain Utility Demonstration

Dhaniverse showcases practical blockchain integration that enhances rather than replaces traditional systems:

- **Tamper-proof Financial Records**: Player banking data stored immutably on ICP
- **Verifiable Achievements**: Stock trading leaderboards that can't be manipulated
- **Decentralized Identity**: Principal-based authentication for secure, portable user profiles
- **Educational Transparency**: On-chain data proves learning progress and financial literacy gains

### Technical Innovation

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Game works perfectly without blockchain, enhanced with ICP
- **Dual Storage Architecture**: Intelligent switching between local and on-chain data
- **Real-world Application**: Blockchain solves actual problems in financial education
- **User-friendly Onboarding**: Optional wallet connection doesn't disrupt gameplay flow

### Hackathon Demo Flow

1. **Traditional Gameplay**: Start playing immediately without any blockchain setup
2. **Wallet Connection**: Optional ICP wallet integration for enhanced features
3. **On-chain Banking**: Deposit/withdraw with immutable transaction records
4. **Leaderboard Competition**: Compete on tamper-proof trading performance rankings
5. **Data Verification**: Demonstrate blockchain data integrity and transparency

## Deploying the Frontend to Internet Computer (ICP)

This project includes a ready-to-deploy `assets` canister that can serve the `dist` frontend build.

1. Build the frontend (if you have Node.js installed):

	npm ci
	npm run build

2. Start dfx (local):

	dfx start --clean --background

3. Deploy the assets canister locally:

	dfx deploy frontend_assets

4. Deploy to the IC network (mainnet/testnet):

	dfx build --network ic
	dfx deploy --network ic

Or use the helper script:

	bash scripts/deploy-assets.sh

Notes:
- The canister is defined in `dfx.json` as `frontend_assets` and serves files from `./dist`.
- If `npm` is missing, ensure `dist` is present and up-to-date before deploying.
